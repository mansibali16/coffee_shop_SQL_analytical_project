# coffee_shop_SQL_analytical_project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of coffee shop sales data using SQL. The data, originally stored in a CSV file, undergoes thorough preprocessing before being loaded into a SQL database. Various SQL queries are then executed to extract valuable insights and generate useful reports that help in understanding the sales patterns and performance of the coffee shop.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The raw sales data in the CSV file is cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy before being imported into the SQL database.
- **Database Design**: The data is structured into well-organized tables with appropriate relationships, enabling efficient querying and analysis.
- **Comprehensive Queries**: A wide range of SQL queries are fired to analyze different aspects of the sales data, including:
  - Sales trends over time
  - Best-selling products
  - Peak sales hours and days
  - Customer purchasing patterns
  - Inventory management insights

## Getting Started

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the CSV data.
2. **Database Setup**: Import the preprocessed data into the SQL database by running the provided SQL scripts.
3. **Execute Queries**: Use the provided SQL query scripts to analyze the sales data and generate reports.

## Requirements

- SQL Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- CSV file containing the raw sales data
- Preprocessing script (provided)
- SQL query scripts (provided)

## Usage

1. Preprocess the CSV data using the provided script to ensure it is ready for database import.
2. Set up your SQL database and import the preprocessed data.
3. Execute the SQL queries to explore and analyze the sales data.

## Conclusion
